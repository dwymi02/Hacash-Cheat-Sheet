## Interesting Hacash reading:

### An interesting question and response regarding "Why Hacash is better than Bitcoin?"
* [Why hacash is better than Bitcoin?]([https://hacashtalk.com/t/why-hacash-is-better-than-bitcoin/48)

### Ken You responds:

### This is a great question. Here is my 5 reasons why Hacash is better than Bitcoin from the money perspective:
* 1. Divisibility ****--**** Hacash’s divisibility is 10^248, Bitcoin is only 10^8
* 2. Privacy ****--**** Hacash has optional privacy transaction feature, but Bitcoin doesn’t have it.
* 3. Fairness of Production Competition ****--**** Unlike Bitcoin, HAC has no upper limit. Its block reward mechanism follows the Fibonacci sequence. Within the first 6 years, block rewards will be 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 per block as determined by block height. Once the block rewards reach 8 HAC per block, the reward will remain at 8 for ten years, and then start to follow the sequence back down 5, 3, 2, 1,1, each block reward period lasting ten years; finally reaching 22 million in 66 years. After that, 1 HAC will be rewarded in each block forever**. Through this mechanism, the relative fairness of production competition among subsequent participants was ensured. Bitcoin’s halving every four years from the beginning of 50 resulted in subsequent participants being at a disadvantage in production competition due to information gap. What’s more, Hacash’s X16RS algorithm should be hard than Bitcoin’s sha-256 to develop the rigs from CPU to GPU mining, so that the competition is more fair.
* 4. Elasticity ****--**** Bitcoin lacks the elasticity that gold has as the money. When the price of gold rises sharply, it will be mined more, while the price of gold will be mined less. However, no matter how the price of Bitcoin changes, it is always produced in a fixed amount, lacking money elasticity. In addition, in the age when gold was used as money, it also had metals with different characteristics. For example, a multi-standard system composed of gold, silver, and copper can bring more flexibility to the market. Such an elasticity setting is not necessarily the best, but it must be better than a single gold standard. Such an elasticity setting is left to the market, it gives people more choice, and everyone can participate in it. Crypto currency also needs to introduce such a multi-standard system to solve the problem of money being spent by others. The total amount of Bitcoin is unlimited and a single currency, which only solves the problem of our holdings, but does not solve the problem of our spending. There are three currency designs in the entire Hacash, namely HAC, Hacash Diamond and Bitcoin.

* HAC can be divided infinitely, and the total amount has no upper limit.
* Hacash Diamond (HACD) is indivisible, and the total amount has an upper limit.
* Bitcoin is divisible, and the total amount has an upper limit. At the same time, the number of HAC can be increased through the transfer of Bitcoin in Hacash chain.

The unlimited division of HAC and the unlimited total amount ensure that our overall attitude towards HAC is to spend instead of storage. The indivisibility of HACD and the upper limit of total amount ensure that our overall attitude towards HACD is to collect and store, not spend, and Bitcoin’s role is to be the originator of crypto currency, through its transfer to increase the number of HAC, increase the recognition of HAC, and more importantly, the balance of Hacash’s entire monetary system. When the price of HAC rises to the point where the Bitcoin transfer is profitable, someone will transfer Bitcoin to issue additional HAC, and at the same time, to a certain extent, restrain the price increase of HAC. The HAC whose price has fallen will be used to bid for HACD, ​after the bidding continued to rise, it drove the price of HAC, and Bitcoin came to transfer additional HAC. The whole process forms a monetary elasticity mechanism, and such a mechanism does not need to be separated from the relationship between gold, silver and copper, but directly occurs in a one single blockchain.

* 5. Transaction - Layer 2 solution ****--**** The technology that allows Bitcoin to approach the speed of digital currency is called the Lightning Network, but the Lightning Network has the problem of holding Bitcoin. The technology that Hacash can reach the same speed as digital currency is called the channel chain settlement network, which completely eliminates the problem of holding HAC, and also supports Bitcoin transactions without holding any Bitcoins. But ****“Better than Bitcoin”**** may really be an inappropriate phrase. Because hacash essentially does not intend to kill Bitcoin, on the contrary, it is to integrate it and become a part of itself. The phrase “better than Bitcoin” triggers resistance because it forces people to choose between hacash and Bitcoin. So I believe that Hacash chain will absorb Bitcoin and retain the value of Bitcoin is the way to make both Bitcoin and Hacash successful. They coexist side by side.

## Public Hacash pools:

### Mining pools are Hacash nodes, where the constant race to solve Hacash blocks occur

### Note: mining pools differ from solo miners, in that mining pools reward miners with share rewards, without having to solve Hacash blocks. While solo miners are only rewarded when they solve the nonce for a Hacash block

### Following is excerpted from [Pool Rewards Explained](https://hacashpool.com/start-mining)

The mining pool rewards both block producers and non-block producers in the pool ensuring that everyone contributing mining power is rewarded. Specifically, in addition to any transaction processing fees for a mined block of the mining pool, the block producers receive 50% of the reward separately, and the remaining 50% of the block reward is divided among the other pool miners based on their mining power contribution for the time period.

For example, let’s say we have 5 Pool Workers (abbreviated “PW”). Each PW contributes equal amounts of mining power to the pool (20% each). PW-1 then successfully discovers the next block. PW-1 will receive 50% of the block reward. PWs-2, 3, 4 and 5 will then equally split the remaining 50% of the block reward since they were contributing equal mining power. Of course, in the real world, different PWs will contribute different amounts of mining power. Each PW is rewarded based on the power that is being contributed to the pool.

A special note for those with powerful mining machines: If a certain address contributes more than 50% of the total computing power of the mining pool, the excess reward will be automatically distributed to other participants. In other words, if you have a lot of computing power, the best way is to spread it in multiple different addresses and decentralize the computing power.

## Important Hacash mining considerations:

### Before you start mining it will be necessary to ensure you have the requisite tools that will ensure your success mining Hacash
* As of the publication of this cheat sheet, Hacash is a CPU miner
* Presently, Hacash does not support GPU mining. Hacash may have support in the future. Use the important resources and social media resources to keep up to date with future Hacash developments
* Hacash is a Proof of Work (PoW), which means there is a worldwide competition to solve the mathematical puzzle, to be rewarded with shares of Hacash
* Hacash uses x16rs for PoW, comprised of 16 versions of SHA3. The hash algorithms used by x16rs are [Blake, BMW, Groestl, Jh, Keccak, Skein, Luffa, Cubehash, Shavite, Simd, Echo, Hamsi, Fugue, Shabal, Whirlpool, SHA512]
* Hacash is exclusively CPU intensive. Hacash is not reliant on memory. So when it comes to workstations one should focus on the number of cores and CPU speed. Simple rule, the more cores and the higher the CPU speed, the better will be your mining results.

## Creating your own Hacash wallet:

### In this section you will be introduced to the Hacash wallet. The Hacash wallet are the keys, consisting of a public / private key that provides access to Hacash, a world leading alternative to the debt fiat currencies, run by the Global Central Banks
Many people are confused by the use of the public / private keys used by Hacash. To help you to understand the public / private key relationship used by Hacash, I will use your typical bank analogy.

Everyone understands how consumer banks operate.

First you need to open a bank account.

To open a bank account, you need to provide documentation proving your identity, where you live and source of income.

Once the bank decides to allow you to open an account, the bank will assign you a bank account number, a small number of checks, to allow you access to funds in your account and may optimally issue you a bank debit card.

The bank debit card and completed bank check are analogous to your Hacash public key. Your Hacash public key is like the bank debit card. Your Hacash public key represents what the public can see, just like your bank debit card or completed bank check. Your Hacash private key is analogous to your bank debit card pin number or your blank bank check. You would never give anyone your blank bank check and you certainly would never divulge your bank debit card pin number. Your Hacash private key allows the holder of the Hacash private key to spend, to pay bills, order services, buy the things you need, splurge on the things you want. Without your Hacash private key, you can do none of these things. It would be like forgetting your bank debit card pin number, if you don't have it and you don't have any of the Central Bank fiat currency in your pocket, you won't be able to buy anything.

For creating a Hacash wallet please refer to [Quick start](https://hacash.org/page/start_en.html)
There are two methods of creating a Hacash wallet, [Online Wallets](https://wallet.hacash.org/) or by downloading [Command-line Wallets](https://github.com/hacash/cmdwallet)

It is absolutely critical to understand that the public / private keys are inseparable. Once you decide to create a Hacash wallet, you must ensure that every possible means is employed to safely secure your Hacash wallet. If you lose either your public or private Hacash wallet keys, you will have lost access to your Hacash resources. While you can publicly advertise your Hacash public key to the world, your Hacash private key must be kept secret.


## Setting up a Hacash pool miner:

### In this section we will be discussing how to set up your workstation to begin pool mining Hacash

### Before beginning a discussion on configuring a Hacash pool miner, one needs to understand the benefits of pool mining as opposed to Hacash solo mining, which we will also outline in this Hacash Cheat Sheet. Generally, new miners dabble with solo mining, only to quickly become frustrated over results, then give up incorrectly believing that mining is not profitable. Firstly, one needs to understand when you should solo mine and when you need to pool mine. The Hacash miner application provides useful information, once you know what to look for. Once your Hacash miner is running, take a good look at console log. An example of the console log is provided:

    do mining height:‹231855›, cbmn:54... upload hash: 231854, 000000963c112af958095885..., time: 244s, hashrate: 12.566TH/s ok.

### Notice the value for [hashrate:], the value reads [12.566TH/s]. This is what you want to look for. Possible values, from lowest to highest are [GH/s], [TH/s], [PH/s]. If your miner is reporting a hash rate in [GH/s] or low [TH/s], then you should be pool mining. On the other hand, if your miner is reporting hash rates in the high [TH/s] or even [PH/s], then you should consider solo mining. That having been said, even if you have extremely high hash rates, you can still pool mine. That is a decision each individual must make for themselves.

### Now we will quickly go over some of the differences between Hacash pool mining and Hacash solo mining. We will start with Hacash solo mining. When one Hacash solo mines the only reward is when the Hacash miner solves the nonce for the Hacash blockchain. Which is the primary reason why individuals with moderately powered computers must pool mine. In pool mining, there are two methods for receiving Hacash rewards. The most lucrative is solving the nonce for the Hacash blockchain, the other being rewarded with Hacash shares for contributing to the integrity and security of the Hacash blockchain. Once a pool miner accrues enough Hacash rewards, the pool will send to your public Hacash public key wallet, your accrued Hacash shares. Over time, one can accumulate a vast amount of Hacash.

### Another distinguishing characteristic between Hacash pools and Hacash nodes is every Hacash pool must have three ports open to the world, these ports are port # 3338 for basic nodes, port # 3339, which connects the pool to Hacash client applications, viz., the executable we run to perform mining operations and port # 3340, which allows users to monitor their Hacash clients, along with other clients also connected to the pool.

### The software to run a Hacash pool miner either for UNIX/Linux or Windows can be accessed at [Join mining pool mining](https://hacash.org/page/start_en.html#poolworker) or from [Hacash Software Download link and Release log](https://github.com/hacash/miner/blob/master/doc/software_release_log.md).

### For the UNIX/Linux version use either [Download pool mining software](http://download.hacash.org:8080/miner_pool_worker_hacash_ubuntu64.zip) or [Hacash Software Download link and Release log ; 2. Miner pool worker:](http://download.hacash.org:8080/miner_pool_worker_hacash_ubuntu64.zip).

### For the Windows version use either [Download pool mining software](http://download.hacash.org:8080/miner_pool_worker_hacash_windows64.zip) or [Hacash Software Download link and Release log ; 2. Miner pool worker:](http://download.hacash.org:8080/miner_pool_worker_hacash_windows64.zip)


Once you unpack the zip archives you will see two files, an executable, with the following naming convention:
#### hacash_miner_pool_worker_YYYY_MM_DD_VV, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day and VV is the release version

#### Note: Windows executables will have a file extension of [.exe], while UNIX/Linux avoids this convention.

#### The other file is the Hacash pool miner configuration file with the name poolworker.config.ini

#### Note: If you rename or delete the file poolworker.config.ini and begin mining by running the pool worker executable, default values will be taken, which may not be suitable for your machines configuration. When starting the Hacash pool worker, carefully examine the console log to ensure that what is displayed on the console screen matches your configuration settings.

#### The poolworker.config.ini configuration file consists of three keywords, they are [pool], [rewards] and [supervene]

#### The [pool] keyword specifies the IP address or URL and port number, where you wish to pool mine Hacash. Examples of existing public Hacash pools would be [http://www.hacpool.com] or [http://hacash.net]. You can specify either the IP address or the URL with the port number the site uses for incoming connections.

#### The [rewards] keyword is your Hacash public wallet address key.

#### The [supervene] keyword represents the number of cores your workstation has installed. So, for example, your workstation has 8 cores, you would set this keyword to the number of cores on your workstation.

#### Following is an example of the file poolworker.config.ini, which at the time of this writing are the contents of the original pool worker configuration file:

    pool = 182.92.163.225:3339
    rewards = 1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS
    supervene = 8

#### The [pool] keyword directs the Hacash pool worker to access the public Hacash pool using IP address [182.92.163.225], the pool server uses port number 3339 to listen for new connections

#### The [rewards] keyword specifies the Hacash public wallet key. Hacash shares are accumulated by the Hacash pool server and are distributed to your Hacash public wallet key.

#### Once you commence Hacash mining operations, I would recommend using your favorite web browser to track progress of your workers by specifying the [pool] IP address using port number [:3340].

So, the following is how you would enter this into your browser:

    https://182.92.163.225:3340

The results will appear as follows (formatted to fit):

    FeeRatio: 10.00 %, Addr: 1BGxnkVmNQECbvBYbvdquFQZBLgBpVLkYr

    Port: 3339

### Following is a brief explanation to help you understand the web page contents. In the first line we have:

    FeeRatio: 10.00 %, Addr: 1BGxnkVmNQECbvBYbvdquFQZBLgBpVLkYr

### FeeRatio is the fee the pool charges each miner for the privilege of using their pool. Next, we have Addr: followed by [1BGxnkVmNQECbvBYbvdquFQZBLgBpVLkYr], which is the pools Hacash public key. Reminder, this Hacash public key can be plugged into the Hacash explorer [Hacash Explorer](https://explorer.hacash.org/address/1BGxnkVmNQECbvBYbvdquFQZBLgBpVLkYr) and you can see all their Hacash transactions. For example, you have been mining on a Hacash pool and you have been awarded shares of Hacash, you could use the pools Hacash public key that will display recent transactions in the Hacash explorer. You should then look for your own Hacash public key, which will show up as one of the many transactions. Your transaction, when you find it, will contain your Hacash public key, the amount of the transaction and the time the transaction occurred. I find this to be very useful.

### Next line we have:

    Port: 3339

### Port: 3339, provides information about which TCP port your pool uses for the Hacash explorer.

### Next line we have:

    TotalClients: 9

### TotalClients: 9, provides information on the number of clients presently mining on this pool. In our example there are a total of five miners, identified by the Hacash public key, two of which are not active. Of the three active miners, one miner has a total of six rigs mining. While another miner has two rigs. This information can be helpful in determining which pool you want to participate with.

### Lastly, we have our column headers, which summarizes each of the miners information regarding recent mining operations on this pool. The column headers are:

    Address  Clients  PeriodPowWorth  FindBlocks/Coins  CompleteRewards  DeservedRewards  UnconfirmedRewards

### [Address] represents the Hacash public key used by this miner

### [Clients] represents the number of rigs, actual computers running the Hacash Pool miner, deployed by this miner

### [PeriodPowWorth] represents, for a specified period of time, a measurement of the contribution the total of all the miners rigs have contributed to finding the Hacash nonce, viz., the miners hashing rate. The higher this value means the greater the chance of this miners rigs will be in finding the Hacash nonce.

### [FindBlocks/Coins] represents the number of Hacash blocks each miner has found, since they joined this pool. For example, miner # 3, with 1 rig has not yet solved any Hacash nonce. While miner # 1, with 6 rigs has been able to solve 24 Hacash nonce blocks

### [CompletedRewards] represents the amount of [Hacash] that has been transferred to their Hacash public key. As you can see Miner # 1 has amassed a significant amount of Hacash. This alone, should demonstrate, the potential Hacash offers to all those that can reap the available benefits.

### [DeservedRewards] represents the current amount of Hacash that will eventually deposited into the miners Hacash public key. Based on miner activity, Hacash rewards are accumulated, then paid to the miner at certain thresholds, which changes, again based on mining activity.

### [UnconfirmedRewards] represents the current amount of Hacash that will eventually be transferred from [UnconfirmedRewards] over to [DeservedRewards]. Once Hacash rewards have been confirmed and certain threshold, which change, based on mining activity, eventually [UnconfirmedRewards] will be migrated over to [DeservedRewards]. In summary, based on observations, one with a good set of mining rigs could achieve on average of at least one payout to your Hacash public key on a daily basis. Obviously, those with the wherewithal to have significant number of rigs and processing power will achieve better results.


### Lastly, setting proper expectations for Hacash pool mining. Hacash mining is different from mining most other cryptocurrencies. Most cryptocurrency PoW miners are based on a single hash algorithm. So once the mining application has established itself, these mining applications will drone on at a constant hash rate, seldom ever deviating from it's established norms. Mining Hacash, if anything, is dynamic. This the result of the use of the x16rs hash algorithm. Instead of mining at a constant rate, Hacash hash rates will fluctuate. The way I view this fluctuation is to view these changes as changes in cycles. I have observed Hacash mining at low hash rates, low for my mining rigs would be around 5TH/s, for short periods of time and also for very long periods of time. I have also observed Hacash mining at higher hash rates for extended periods of time, elevated levels for my mining rigs would be around 55TH/s, sometimes for a couple of hours an even for several days consecutively. Some people become frustrated mining at lower hash rates, they want to always mine at the higher hash rate all of the time. How one can mitigate the potential for mining low hash rates would be to add additional machines. The decision to add additional computing power is up to the individual to make, in order to meet their specific requirements. As for myself, accustomed am I with the unique characteristics embodied in the x16rs algorithm. I understand that the Hacash PoW is working as designed. When the Hacash PoW enters these long, extended cycles at lower hash rates, these long cycles will then be followed by long, sometimes extended longer cycles at high or even exceedingly higher hash rates. Once these longer higher hash rates begin to ramp up, the opportunity for solving Hacash blocks increases. By understanding how the Hacash PoW works, the miner will see the benefits of allowing the algorithm to perform the job it was designed to perform.



## Setting up a Hacash solo miner:

### In this section we will be discussing how to set up your workstation to begin solo mining Hacash
### The software to run a Hacash solo miner either for UNIX/Linux or Windows can be accessed at [Full node mining](https://hacash.org/page/start_en.html#minernode) or from [Hacash Software Download link and Release log](https://github.com/hacash/miner/blob/master/doc/software_release_log.md).

### For the UNIX/Linux version use either [Download mining node software](http://download.hacash.org:8080/miner_node_hacash_ubuntu64.zip) or [Hacash Software Download link and Release log ; 1. Hacash full node:](http://download.hacash.org:8080/miner_node_hacash_ubuntu64.zip).

###For the Windows version use either [Download mining node software](http://download.hacash.org:8080/miner_node_hacash_windows64.zip) or [Hacash Software Download link and Release log ; 1. Hacash full node:](http://download.hacash.org:8080/miner_node_hacash_windows64.zip)


Once you unpack the zip archives you will see two files, an executable, with the following naming convention:
#### hacash_miner_node_hacash_YYYY_MM_DD_VV, where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day and VV is the release version

#### Note: Windows executables will have a file extension of [.exe], while UNIX/Linux avoids this convention.

#### The other file is the Hacash pool miner configuration file with the name hacash.config.ini

#### Note: If you rename or delete the file hacash.config.ini and begin mining by running the pool worker executable, default values will be taken, which may not be suitable for your machines configuration. When starting the Hacash solo worker, carefully examine the console log to ensure that what is displayed on the console screen matches your configuration settings.

#### The hacash.config.ini configuration file is divided into six sections, they are [p2p], [miner], [minerpool], [diamondminer], [service] and [btcmovecheck]

#### The following sections will not be discussed here. No changes should be made to any of the sections listed. Changing values for these keywords could result in unpredictable mining behavior. To reiterate, when solo mining, make no changes to the following sections in the file hacash.config.ini. The sections to be ignored are [p2p], [minerpool], [diamondminer], [service] and [btcmovecheck]

#### The section to be updated for solo mining is [miner], the keywords, within the [miner] section that we will look at are [enable], [supervene], [rewards] and [message].

#### When you look at the section [miner], you will notice that there is a [;] preceding the [enable] keyword. Anything after the [;] are treated as comments, meaning that the Hacash solo miner will use the default for this keyword. If no changes were to be made, when the Hacash solo miner is started, no mining threads would be started. This is not the behavior we desire, we want to solve as many Hacash nonce's as possible. To facilitate this we need to remove the [;] from the [enable] keyword. Once the [;] has been removed from the [enable] keyword, we need to set the next Hacash solo miner keyword.

#### The [rewards] keyword is your Hacash public wallet address key.

#### The [supervene] keyword represents the number of cores your workstation has installed. So, for example, your workstation has 8 cores, you would set this keyword to the number of cores on your workstation.

#### The [rewards] keyword is your Hacash public wallet address key.

#### The [message] keyword represents the name of your solo miner. When assigning a name, long names will get truncated, when viewed publicly.

#### Because the hacash.config.ini contains a number of lines, we will display the contents of a hacash.config.ini ready for use as a solo miner, which would be as follows (white space lines have been omitted):
